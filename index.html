<h3 id="ideation-phase-">Ideation Phase 💡</h3>
<p>Brainstorm ideas for the application, such as the possible architecture. Mock up the UI (in MS Paint), decide on the Font, button styling, theme. Make paper mockups of the UI as well based on the specifications. </p>
<p>Also, list down the specified tools as per the specifications.</p>
<h3 id="initial-run-through-">Initial Run-through ➡️</h3>
<p>Run through the video/article to get an idea about the topic to implement or work on. You should re-run through the topics (An overview) in a top 🡪 bottom approach. </p>
<p><strong>What is Top 🡪 Bottom Approach?</strong>
Initially, you have to glance through the article/webpage/video to get an idea of what it is. You don&#39;t need to understand each nook and corner. Next, if you are implementing something, circle out the thing (which is important) and ask any AI (ChatGPT/Gemini/Copilot) to explain the topic with examples/code (if applicable), also ask for analogies for easier understanding.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-phase-">Implementation Phase ⚒️</h3>
<p>Implement the application in the platform (like VS Code, IntelliJ, or any other IDE/Text editor). Install the required libraries/dependencies. Use AI/Google on troubleshooting and to properly set up the environment.</p>
<h3 id="error-correction-phase-">Error Correction Phase ❌</h3>
<p>Correct errors in code and test every single file/component and make sure everything works as intended. After satisfaction, proceed to deploy the application.</p>
<p>🎉 Congratulations! Now, you have deployed your application successfully.</p>
